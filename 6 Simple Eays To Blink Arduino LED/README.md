# 6 Simple ways to blink an LED using Arduino

Here are 6 simple ways for blinking and Arduino led using an Arduino board.

**1) Blink LED using Delay.**
 * Simplest method to understand as a beginner.
 * Code will be blocked due to delay.
 * Code uses 924 bytes of program memory and Global variables use 9 bytes.

**2) Blink LED using Counter variable**
 * Also simple to understand
 * Code will be none Blocking.
 * Code uses 810 bytes of program memory and Global variables use 13 bytes.

**3) Blink LED using Millis function**
 * Moderate to understand.
 * Code will be none Blocking.
 * Code uses 924 bytes of program memory and Global variables use 9 bytes.

**4) Blink LED using Watchdog Interrupt**
 * Little tricky to understand.
 * Code will be none Blocking.	
 * Code uses 810 bytes of program memory and Global variables use 10 bytes.

**5) Blink LED using  Timer Interrupt**
 * Tricky to understand.
 * Code will be none Blocking.
` * Code uses 880 bytes of program memory and Global variables use 10 bytes.

**6) Blink LED using Hardware Timer Toggle**
 * Tricky to understand.
 * Code will be none Blocking.
 * Code uses 634 bytes of program memory and Global variables use 9 bytes.
